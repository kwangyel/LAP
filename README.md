This is a GIS tool box for use in land pooling schemes and urban planning

Tools:-

1. Slope Plus:
This tool generates a TIN surface delimited by the boundary and also a feature class showing the slope analysis of the surface. The input for the tool is a CAD polyline feature with height values and another CAD polygon which is the boundary of the surface.
The classbreak.csv file defines the classes into which the slope will be analysed. You can modify that class to suit your needs.

2. Feature to Point tool:
This tool is used to convert a label of a feature class to a CAD annotation. The user can choose which feild that want to export as an annotation and a point feature will be generated. Now this point feature can be directly exported to CAD to annotation will be generated.
